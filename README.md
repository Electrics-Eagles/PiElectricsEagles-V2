# PiElectricsEagles-V2
We aim to create affordable, easy-to-use drones that can be operated out of the box without any setup or tuning required. Our concept involves connecting a microcontroller to a Linux mini PC to control flight and enable artificial intelligence and 4G connectivity for more advanced applications. Follow our journey to build the ultimate tiny drone!
